SOME of these PNG's might not be fully compatible with your graphics editor.
This is because not all editors support 8-bit alpha transparency atm (PSP, PS, GIMP not supported yet)

So if the picture looks messed up, open it with Paint.NET and save it again. Paint.NET will
save it as a 32bit picture again so that any editor can open them.

Furthermore, some of these PNG's  is just renamed jpg files (like about.png). So if your program
can't open them just rename the extension to .jpg. Remember to rename back for it to show in Winamp again.
The reason behind this method is that sometime a jpg file uses much less size than a PNG file. This is useful
if the picture don't need lossless quality.

Remember to reduce the size of all your PNG's  afterwards by using PNGGauntlet on default settings.
At the end of the day each kb you can save will help your skin to load faster ;)
